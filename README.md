## Overview

This changelog outlines five bugs that were found and fixed in the  
Lead Management & Scheduling App.

---

### 1. Duplicate Confirmation Emails

**File**: `src/services/emailService.ts`  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Status**: Fixed

#### What Happened

Submitting a lead sent two identical confirmation emails to users instead of just one.

#### Cause of the Issue

The send function was executed twice in different parts of the workflow without a duplication check.

#### Solution Implemented

Removed the extra trigger and added a safeguard to allow only a single send.

#### Result

- ✅ One confirmation email per submission
- ✅ Reduced email server strain
- ✅ Lower risk of emails being flagged as spam

### 2. AI Producing Fallback Responses Too Frequently

**File**: `src/services/aiHandler.ts`  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Status**: Fixed

#### What Happened

The AI frequently returned a generic fallback message instead of relevant, personalized output.

#### Cause of the Issue

The code accessed `choices[1]` rather than the intended `choices[0]` in the API response.

#### Solution Implemented

Adjusted the logic to consistently retrieve data from `choices[0]`.

#### Result

- ✅ More accurate AI-generated answers
- ✅ Reduced dependency on fallback text
- ✅ Improved user interaction quality

### 3. Missing Industry Information in Leads

**File**: `src/types/Lead.ts`  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Status**: Fixed

#### What Happened

Leads did not include the industry field even when it was selected in the form.

#### Cause of the Issue

The `Lead` type definition did not contain the `industry` property after form updates.

#### Solution Implemented

Added the `industry` property and ensured correct mapping during form submission.

#### Result

- ✅ Complete lead data profiles
- ✅ More precise business categorization
- ✅ No silent loss of industry data

---

### 4. State Desynchronization Between Local and Global Stores

**File**: `src/components/LeadForm.tsx`  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Status**: Fixed

#### What Happened

In some cases, lead data displayed inconsistently due to differences between component state and the global Zustand store.

#### Cause of the Issue

Both local state and global state were being updated separately, causing mismatches.

#### Solution Implemented

Refactored to use only the `addLead` method from the Zustand store for updates.

#### Result

- ✅ Unified state management
- ✅ Eliminated conflicting updates
- ✅ More predictable application behavior

---

### 5. Leads Not Persisting in Database

**File**: `src/services/databaseService.ts`  
**Severity**: Major  
**Status**: Fixed

#### What Happened

After refreshing the page, newly submitted leads disappeared.

#### Cause of the Issue

The submission flow only stored data locally without inserting it into the Supabase database.

#### Solution Implemented

Added a Supabase insert operation immediately following successful submission.

#### Result

- ✅ Permanent storage of all submitted leads
- ✅ Local and remote data kept in sync
- ✅ Prevented accidental loss after reload
